<p><font size="4">Dear friends and our valued customers</font></p>

<p>Nails Only would like to thank you for supporting us over the past 10 years. Without you, our success would not be possible.</p>

<p>The road has not always been easy. Adjusting to a new culture has been, at times, challenging. Also, adjusting to winter has been difficult! We’ve lived through many Minnesota winters since 1975. But we’ve prevailed. Our son have been born and raised here and we’ve come to welcome this great state as our home.  </p>
<p>One of the wonderful things about Minnesota is its diversity. The Land of 10,000 lakes is also home to thousands of activities, sites and attractions. From its many malls to its large corporations, schools, parks and professional sports teams, Minnesota is truly unique.  </p>
<p>Spread the word. If you have family and friends who are coming to visit and enjoy the beauty of Minnesota, or have new neighbors who’ve just moved here, tell them about Nails Only. We’re just six miles from the Mall of America and can take care of any nail and massage needs.  </p>
<p>As we look back on a fantastic several years, we thank you again for your patronage. We look forward to more growth and success. Most importantly, we look forward to the opportunity to serve you, your family and friends right here in Richfield, Minnesota! </p>
<p><strong><em>Thanks <br /> Carol and Dai Vinh </em></strong></p>
