<p>Reflexology spells relief to me.  My feet have never thanked me more.  Plus my neck and back welcome their weekly massage.  I am soooo happy I was lead to Dai Vinh at NAILS ONLY because my daily tension is much less than it has been for YEARS.</p>
<p>Have been to see you twice for reflexology/foot massage.  I wanted to share a few things with you since I've been coming:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I am definitely sleeping more soundly and calmly</li>
		<li>I feel better overall</li>
		<li>My internal faith and confidence is higher, especially in light of all the things that are going on to cause fear and doubt</li>
		<li>I am more affectionate and joyful</li>
		<li>I feel healthier</li>
	</ul>
<p>
You have a relaxing spirit too and this helps me feel like I can trust your services.
I have been coming in weekly for the 30 minute Reflexology Foot Massage.  My right leg has been bothering me for years and the massage helps a lot with circulation and inflammation.  I usually come limping in for my appointment and am able to walk much better on the way out of the salon.  My thanks to Dai Vinh.</p>
<p>
I am writing to let you know how much I enjoyed the Nails Only Party.  It was really a nice treat to spend time with friends getting pampered and enjoying my birthday.  We loved having the salon to ourselves for our own private party.  Thanks to you and your staff for a great job.</p>
<p>
Nails Only has got the right idea.  Gather your group of friends, bring appetizers and beverages, choose your color, and enjoy a relaxing mani/pedi as you socialize together. We had a ball at our Mother/Daughter Back to School Nail Party so we did it again before Christmas! Nails Only is clean with professional and courteous nail technicians, and the price is right.  Why someone would go anywhere else is a mystery to me. I love Nails Only!</p>  
<p>Thanks so much for your careful care this past week.  First of all I had a wonderful manicure.  The young lady who did my nails and hand massage was wonderful.</p>
