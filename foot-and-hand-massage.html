  <p>&quot;I have tounge and  throat cancer and was given some E-water, made by the PHUT-C and that  was the first drink of water in 7 months. I am on a liquid diet through  a port.&quot; <em>Glen</em></p>
  <p>&quot;I was hit by a car and was paralized from the neck down, over time  I have use of my arms. When I have the PHUT-C session done I can feel  pins and needles at my waist line, I believe I will walk some day  soon.&quot; <em>DQ</em></p>
  <p>&quot;I was diagnosised with brest cancer. My first PHUT-C session within  20 minutes, the pain from the brest biopsy was gone!! Two days later, I  had my right foot in one bucket, my left in another and one more for my  hands, each with a PHUT-C. After 10 minutes, my right bucket was clear  water, and the other two were brown. I have cancer in the left brest,  not the right! I feel great and will beat this cancer.&quot; <em>Roberta</em></p>
  <p>&quot;My daughter is a  Type 1 diabetic and her blood sugar level was 271 before a 30 minute  PHUT-C foot bath. Immediately after it went to 215, and an hour later  it dropped to 198! the pain in her ankle disappeared too.&quot; <em>Pattie I.</em></p>
  <p>&quot;My client was  recoving from a broken bone in her foot, she was limping and in pain.  After one session, she never used her crutches, and is feeling great.&quot; <em>C.H.</em></p>
  <p>&quot;I couldn't walk; I  was hopping around the house on one leg. After one session the pain was  gone. My doctor told me it probably took out the lactic acid. I don't  care what it did, I am pain free.&quot; <em>L.N.</em></p>
  <p>&quot;Urinate to Eliminate Excees Weight&quot; That is what happens when I  drink &quot;energized&quot; water. I drink two to three liters of &quot;energized&quot;  water everyday. I have&nbsp;less of an appetite, I have eliminated ten  pounds of excess weight by urinating. I&nbsp;use the PHUT-C to energize my  closed container of drinking water, using tap water in the sink that  surrounds my container. Somehow the energy that the PHUT-C is creating  in the tap water transposes energy into my closed container of drinking  water. After about ten minutes I have to go to the bathroom and  eliminate my toxins. I feel great. <em>T.K.</em></p>
